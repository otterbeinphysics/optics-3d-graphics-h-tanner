The cool thing that my project does is make a cube that rotates in x,y, and z, but that rotation is scaled by the cosine of an angle that changes over time. If you adjust the sliders on the screen, you can adjust how much it will scale change in that direction. You can mess around with them to get some really cool effects (though it's still cool even when you don't adjust the sliders) that collapse and bounce as they spin. There are four cubes, and I made it so that they were all a different size and they all have a different speed at which they rotate and evolve. There were a few things that I was thinking of adding, like the ability to control the speed of the cubes via another slider might be fun, or adding boxes, or collapsing down to 2D to see some other cool effects (where I first noticed the phenomena). 
 
But I think that it meets the requirement for something cool, I've had a lot of fun messing with everything and seeing the cool patterns that you can get out.

Let me know if you have any questions!
